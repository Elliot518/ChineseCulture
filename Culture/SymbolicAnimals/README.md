<hr>

It is a folk tradition in China to use one animal to symbolize the 
year of birth of a person. Shuxiang , also called shengxiao(any of the 12 
animals representing the Earthly Branches), is a traditional way in China 
for chronology and to record a person's age.

### 2. Gregorian calendar(公历) 

公元元年，是公历纪年首年。公历纪年以相传的耶稣基督诞生年作为元年算起，以这一年为界，在此以前的时间称公元前，在此以后的时间称公元后，简称公元年，或直接称年。

<hr>

The Gregorian calendar is commonly used in the world.
The first year of AD is the first year of the Gregorian calendar. The Gregorian calendar is calculated from the year of the birth of Jesus Christ as the first year, with this year as the boundary. The time before this is called BC, and the time after this is called AD, which is referred to as AD year, or directly called year.

### 3. Chinese lunar calendar(中国农历)

中国农历的纪年法与此不同。中国古人发明了用“干支”纪年的方法。以“甲、乙、丙、丁、
戊（Wù）、己、庚（Gēnɡ）、辛、壬（Rén）、癸（Guǐ）”十个“天干”
和“子、丑、寅（Yín）、卯（Mǎo）、辰、巳（Sì）、午、未、申、酉（Yǒu）、戌（Xū）、亥（Hài）”十二个“地
支”按照顺序组合起来，组成 60 对纪年的符号，如：甲子、乙丑、丙寅……这 60 对符号周而复始，循环使用，每一年
就有了一个纪年符号。如公历 2001 年是农历的辛巳年，公历的 2002 年是农历的壬午年。后来，人们又用鼠、牛、虎、兔、龙、蛇、马、羊、猴、鸡、狗、猪 12 种动物来配十二地支，
这就是十二生肖，也叫十二属相，从而形成了这样的搭配：
子鼠、丑牛、寅虎、卯兔、辰龙、巳蛇、午马、未羊、申猴、酉鸡、戌狗、亥猪。这样，子年就是鼠年，
丑年就是牛年，寅年就是虎年……于是，每个人一出生，就有一种动物作他的属相。
子年出生的属鼠，丑年出生的属牛，寅年出生的属虎……属相年也被称作本命年。

The Chinese lunar calendar calculate the years in a different way. 
Ancient Chinese people invented a method to designate years by the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. The Heavenly Stems consist of ten words: jia (Heavenly 
Stem One), yi (Heavenly Stem Two), bing (Heavenly 
Stem Three), ding (Heavenly Stem Four), wu (Heavenly 
Stem Five), ji (Heavenly Stem Six), geng (Heavenly Stem 
Seven), xin (Heavenly Stem Eight), ren (Heavenly Stem Nine), 
and gui (Heavenly Stem Ten). And the Earthly Branches are 
composed of 12 words: zi (Earthly Branch One), chou (Earthly 
Branch Two), yin (Earthly Branch Three), mao (Earthly Branch 
Four), chen (Earthly Branch Five), si (Earthly Branch Six), wu (Earthly 
Branch Seven), wei (Earthly Branch Eight), shen (Earthly Branch 
Nine), you (Earthly Branch Ten), xu (Earthly Branch Eleven), 
and hai (Earthly Branch Twelve). Combining each of the 10 Heavenly 
Stems with one of the 12 Earthly Branches in sequence creates 60 
chronological symbols; for example, jiazi (Heavenly Stem One and 
Earthly Branch One), yichou (Heavenly Stem Two and Earthly Branch 
Two),bingyin (Heavenly Stem Three and Earthly Branch Three), 
etc. These 60 symbols are used in circles and thus each year has a 
chronological symbol. For example, 2001 corresponds to xinsi , 2002 
to renwu in the Chinese lunar calendar. Later, people used 12 animals 
(rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, 
dog and pig) to correspond to the 12 Earthly Branches, forming the 12 
Symbolic Animals, namely, Earthly Branch One—Rat, Earthly Branch 
Two—Ox, Earthly Branch Three—Tiger, Earthly Branch Four—
Rabbit, Earthly Branch Five—Dragon, Earthly Branch Six—Snake, 
Earthly Branch Seven—Horse, Earthly Branch Eight—Sheep, Earthly
Branch Nine—Monkey, Earthly Branch Ten—Rooster, Earthly Branch 
Eleven—Dog, and Earthly Branch Twelve—Pig. Thus the zi year 
is the Year of the Rat, and the chou year is the Year of the Ox, and 
the yin year is the Year of the Tiger, etc…In this way, everyone has 
had an animal as his shuxiang since his birth. Those born in a zi year 
belongs to the sign of the Rat, those born in a chou year the Ox, and 
those in a yin year the Tiger, and so on.

60年一甲子什么意思,中国传统文化之中，一甲子乃为60年。
我们中国人认为六十年是一个轮回。
一甲子为十天干与十二地支相结合而成，地支与天干两两相配，从而组成一甲子。

What does 60 years called one JiaZi mean? 
In traditional Chinese culture, one JiaZi represents 60 years, which is a cycle of sixty years. 
We Chinese believe that sixty years is a reincarnation.

One JiaZi-Year is the combination of ten heavenly stems and twelve earthly branches. 
The earthly branches and heavenly stems match each other. Thus forming a Jiazi.

在中国历法中，甲、乙、丙、丁、戊、己、庚、辛、壬、癸被称为“十天干”。

十二地支，又称十二支，即：子、丑、寅、卯、辰、巳、午、未、申、酉、戌、亥的总称。

六十干支组合乃为：

　　甲子、乙丑、丙寅、丁卯、戊辰、己巳、庚午、辛未、壬申、癸酉

　　甲戌、乙亥、丙子、丁丑、戊寅、己卯、庚辰、辛巳、壬午、癸未

　　甲申、乙酉、丙戌、丁亥、戊子、己丑、庚寅、辛卯、壬辰、癸巳

　　甲午、乙未、丙申、丁酉、戊戌、己亥、庚子、辛丑、壬寅、癸卯
