## Ethnic Groups of China(中国的各名族)

### 1. Brief Introduction(简介)

China is a unitary multi-ethnic country, there are 56 ethnic groups in China.<br>


Since ancient times, Huangdi and Yandi were the common ancestors of the Chinese 
nation. <br>

Huangdi's surname was Ji, and his assumed name was Xuanyuan 
Shi. Yandi was also a legendary ruler whose surname was Jiang and 
assumed name was Shennong Shi. Both Huangdi and Yandi lived in 
the late period of China's primitive society about 4,000 or 5,000 years 
ago, and were the leaders of two different tribes living along the Yellow 
River in present-day Shaanxi Province. A war once broke out between 
Yandi's tribe and the Dongyi group headed by Chiyou in east China; 
Yandi's tribe allied with Huangdi's to defeat Chiyou. Conflicts later 
occurred between Yandi's tribe and Huangdi's, and Yandi's tribe was 
assimilated into Huangdi's after the former was defeated. After long term association and integration, Huangdi's tribe, Yandi's tribe, Dongyi 
and the Miao group in south China formed the mainstay of 
the Huaxia ethnic group, who got the name of the Han in the Han Dynasty.

    华夏：
        
    原指中原地区的人民，也是汉朝以前对汉族先民的称谓。
    后来则包括中国全部领土，也是中国的代称。
    古人以服饰美丽为“华”，以疆界广阔为“夏”，“华夏”的本意就是“文化繁荣而疆域辽阔”。
    我们常常会说华夏大地。

    Huaxia: 
    Originally it means the people in the Central Plains of China, 
    and also the name of the ancestors of the Han people before the Han Dynasty. 
    Later, it contains the whole territory of China 

    The ancient Chinese people described the beauty of clothes as "hua", 
    and the vastness of territory as "xia".
    Therefore the original meaning of "huaxia" means "the prosperity of culture and the vastness of territory."

    黄河流域:
    黄河流域流经青海、四川、甘肃、宁夏、内蒙古、陕西、山西、河南、山东9个省区。
