## Ethnic Groups of China(中国的各名族)

### 1. Brief Introduction(简介)

China is a unitary multi-ethnic country, there are 56 ethnic groups in China.<br>


Since ancient times, Huangdi and Yandi were the common ancestors of the Chinese 
nation. <br>

Huangdi's surname was Ji, and his assumed name was Xuanyuan 
Shi. Yandi was also a legendary ruler whose surname was Jiang and 
assumed name was Shennong Shi. Both Huangdi and Yandi lived in 
the late period of China's primitive society about 4,000 or 5,000 years 
ago, and were the leaders of two different tribes living along the Yellow 
River in present-day Shaanxi Province. A war once broke out between 
Yandi's tribe and the Dongyi group headed by Chiyou in east China; 
Yandi's tribe allied with Huangdi's to defeat Chiyou. Conflicts later 
occurred between Yandi's tribe and Huangdi's, and Yandi's tribe was 
assimilated into Huangdi's after the former was defeated. After long term association and integration, Huangdi's tribe, Yandi's tribe, Dongyi 
and the Miao group in south China formed the mainstay of 
the Huaxia ethnic group, who got the name of the Han in the Han Dynasty.
