### 2. Descendants of the Yan and Huang(炎黄子孙的后代)

Since ancient times, Huangdi and Yandi were the common ancestors of the Chinese 
nation. Therefore, all Chinese are descendants of Yan and Huang. <br>

Huangdi's surname was Ji, and his assumed name was Xuanyuan 
Shi. Yandi was also a legendary ruler whose surname was Jiang and 
assumed name was Shennong Shi. Both Huangdi and Yandi lived in 
the late period of China's primitive society about 4,000 or 5,000 years 
ago, and they were the leaders of two different tribes living along the Yellow 
River in present-day Shanxi Province. <br>
A war once broke out between Yandi's tribe and the Dongyi group which was leaded by Chiyou in east of China, at first Chiyou was so strong and Yandi was defeated by Chiyou. <br>
But later on, Yandi allied with Huangdi, they finally defeated Chiyou. <br>
But conflicts later occurred between Yandi's tribe and Huangdi's, and Yandi's tribe was assimilated into Huangdi's after the it was defeated. After long term association and integration, Huangdi's tribe, Yandi's tribe, Dongyi and the Miao group in south China formed the mainstay of the Huaxia ethnic group. <br>
The Huaxia ethnic group has been called the Han ethnic group since the Han Dynasty.

<hr>

黄帝和炎帝是中华民族的共同祖先。因此, 所有中国人都是炎黄子孙。<br>
黄帝姓姬（Jī），号轩辕氏；炎帝姓姜，号神农氏。<br>
黄帝和炎帝是两个部落的首领，都生活在距今四五千年前的中国原始社会后期。<br>
当时，黄帝部落和炎帝部落都居住在黄河流域。炎帝族曾与中国东部的以蚩尤（Chīyóu）为首领的东夷集团发生战争，炎帝部落联合黄帝部落，打败了蚩尤。<br>
后来，炎帝部落和黄帝部落也发生了冲突，炎帝部落失败后，加入了黄帝部落。<br>
黄帝部落、炎帝部落和东夷以及南方的苗蛮集团经过长期的交往和融合，构成了华夏族的主干。<br>
华夏族自汉朝始称为汉族。

- Supplement knowledge(补充知识点)

    ```
    华夏：
        
    原指中原地区的人民，也是汉朝以前对汉族先民的称谓。
    后来则包括中国全部领土，也是中国的代称。
    古人以服饰美丽为“华”，以疆界广阔为“夏”，“华夏”的本意就是“文化繁荣而疆域辽阔”。
    我们常常会说华夏大地。

    Huaxia: 
    Originally it means the people in the Central Plains of China, 
    and also the name of the ancestors of the Han people before the Han Dynasty. 
    Later, it contains the whole territory of China 

    The ancient Chinese people described the beauty of clothes as "hua", 
    and the vastness of territory as "xia".
    Therefore the original meaning of "huaxia" means "the prosperity of culture and the vastness of territory."

    黄河流域:
    黄河流域流经青海、四川、甘肃、宁夏、内蒙古、陕西、山西、河南、山东9个省区。

### 3. Population distribution of ethnic minorities(少数民族的人口分布)

中国的少数民族虽然人口相对数量很少，但是分布区
域广泛，居住相对集中。广西、内蒙古、新疆、西藏、宁
夏 5 个民族自治区分别是壮族、蒙古族、维吾尔族、藏族、
回族几个较大的少数民族集中居住的地区。云南、青海、
贵州、四川等省份也有大量少数民族聚居，其中，云南省
内有 20 多个少数民族，是中国少数民族聚居最集中的省份。

<hr>

Despite their relatively small populations, the minority ethnic groups of China live in compact communities spread over wide areas. Guangxi, Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet and Ningxia are five ethnic autonomous regions, which are respectively the concentrated habitation areas of several ethnic groups with larger populations, namely the Zhuang, Mongolian, Uyghur, 
Tibetan and Hui. 
In Yunnan, Qinghai, Guizhou, Sichuan and other provinces 
there are also the compact communities of minority ethnic groups. In particular, 
more than 20 minority ethnic groups inhabit Yunnan Province, making it the 
province with the most concentrated habitation of ethnic groups in China.
